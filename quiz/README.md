In what year did two major US Presidential candidates hold election rallies at RPI?

1952



I did the bare minimum for the questions, but I am a little unsatisfied with what I did because I feel like I could've done more. I really wanted to use d3 more to display line charts and change how the displays work, which I wasn't able to get in the 2 hours that I had to do this quiz. I spend the first hour on trying to get the line chart to work and had to eventually scrap it and just made 2 bar charts. In the end, I got everything working but I wish that I spent more time outside of class working with d3 and svg elements so I could use it with d3 more. I also kind of wanted to use a different library (ngx-echarts) which I had more experience with and I think that is easier to work with but the quiz said d3 so I just used d3.
