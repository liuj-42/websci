> Every lab you turn in will have a README.md file. This file will contain a running work log of everything you did for this lab. I especially want to know where you got stuck along the way and what you did to get out of being stuck. One to two sentences isnâ€™t going to cut it here: this is the only opportunity you are going to get to document your own progression so take it seriously. At the end of the semester, I should be able to read through all the README.md files and have a good idea of your growth--as should you!

I would say that this lab wasn't too difficult, it was just a lot of new things to learn but nothing was really in depth. I enjoyed learning about using mongoDB and I hope to learn more about it. I spent the most amount of time for this lab working on the back-end. I originally created a new connection and closed it every request, but then I started having trouble with async functions and all of the things to do with that. I then moved the actions for mongoDB into a function, but I had even more trouble with getting async functions to work because as much as I tried I couldn't get it to work. I eventually found a website that had a tutorial for connecting a restful api with mongodb, and I followed it which helped immensely.


> Additionally, you must cite any tutorials/walkthroughs/YouTube videos/etc. that you used to create both the group portfolio and your personal portfolio. Plagiarism is no good! If you looked at it, you drop the link in your cited sources list. Simple as that. Failure to cite all referenced works will result in a zero for the assignment and a full letter drop in your final grade. When in doubt, email me or the TA.
