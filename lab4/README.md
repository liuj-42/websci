> Every lab you turn in will have a README.md file. This file will contain a running work log of everything you did for this lab. I especially want to know where you got stuck along the way and what you did to get out of being stuck. One to two sentences isnâ€™t going to cut it here: this is the only opportunity you are going to get to document your own progression so take it seriously. At the end of the semester, I should be able to read through all the README.md files and have a good idea of your growth--as should you!

I would say that this lab was particularly difficult for me. I spend a lot of time (2 or 3 hours) trying to get *ngFor to iterate over a json object and in the end I had to give up because I would run out of time. I also spent a lot of time working on translating my javascript from lab 3 to typescript for angular. I was focusing a lot more on the presentation earlier today and I was not able to implement as many features as I would like. For instance, I would've liked to have each song box be its own component with text interpolation to populate the component with but I had to settle for modifying the DOM. I also wanted to possibly add more endpoints for the API but I didn't have enough time to flesh out the current endpoints so I couldn't do that. I will probably work on polishing this lab after I submit it just because I want to add more things to it. I think that I spent too much time trying to get *ngFor to work with my json object and shoudl've focused my efforst on something else instead.

> Additionally, you must cite any tutorials/walkthroughs/YouTube videos/etc. that you used to create both the group portfolio and your personal portfolio. Plagiarism is no good! If you looked at it, you drop the link in your cited sources list. Simple as that. Failure to cite all referenced works will result in a zero for the assignment and a full letter drop in your final grade. When in doubt, email me or the TA.
